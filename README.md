# Machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
Applied unsupervised learning techniques to a wholesale dataset. This involved several key stages: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). Through these steps, I extracted valuable insights for decision-making and business optimization.


### Project Description:
Process:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Pre-processing:
Imported and cleaned the wholesale dataset.
Conducted data summarization and visualization.
Addressed missing values and outliers.
Analyzed correlations between variables.
Transformed and selected features as necessary.


### KMeans Clustering:
Grouped similar products based on attributes.
Determined the optimal number of clusters.
Initialized and updated centroids iteratively.
Identified distinct product segments.


### Hierarchical Clustering:
Merged or split clusters based on similarity.
Determined optimal clusters using hierarchical techniques.
Understood hierarchical relationships among data points.
Identified distinct clusters and their relationships.


### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Analyzed the underlying structure of customer data.
Identified compound feature combinations.
Gained insights into customer segmentation and patterns.


### Conclusion:
Based on the completed analysis:
Identified patterns and relationships within the wholesale dataset.
Uncovered insights for business optimization and decision-making.
Provided valuable information for understanding customer behaviour and preferences.
